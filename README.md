# ConfigFiles
This is an example of an XML based Configuration file I use for controlling a lot of my scripts.  This allows me to transport certain customizations from script to script as well as allowing for making changes without having to go into the script to make updates such as server names or url updates etc.

Typical usage:
Script in it's own unique folder (many of my scripts will create sub-folders and look for config files in the same relative path)
File name of config.xml placed in the same folder as the script.
